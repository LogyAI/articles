#### WHAT DO WE DO?

With the dentists facing the darkest hour, with the growth of COVID-19, dental surgeons are at the highest risk of contracting and transmitting the Coronavirus, alongside paramedics, nurses, and other healthcare workers. Observing these shortcomings, we at LOGY.AI, in the interest of patients, doctors and the healthcare ecosystem which has been highly compromised due to the pandemic, proudly brings you oral health care at comfort of your home **via tele dentistry using artificial intelligence** as our helping tool.

#### WHAT DO WE OFFER?

We created a software (A.I MODEL), which detects oral health conditions like caries, stains, calculus, recession, gingivitis, oral mucosa changes( inflammation, pigmentation, ulcers ).

#### HOW DOES IT WORK?

* The user is instructed to take photos from their respective phones at certain angles.
* The photos are then uploaded on the software and analysed.
* On the basis of a report generated we connect you to the nearest dentist or dental healthcare hospitals, for you to dive into details of oral health conditions you're facing( if a serious or emergency condition is detected),
* Hence further assistance is provided at the comfort of your home.

#### HOW DOES IT HELP THE DENTIST?

* Firstly, we are offering to reduce your screening time.
* Going digital inadvertently reduces your exposure to viruses by means to screen a patient's mouth.
* Giving you a platform for digital consultation.
* Using a digital platform to consult reduces your expenses in procuring preventive care gear like PPE KITS
* Easier connecting you to nearby patients in need.
